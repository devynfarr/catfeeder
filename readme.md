# Catfeeder

This project uses a RTC, Servo, HX711 and load-cell to implement a weight-based cat-feeder (weight of food dispensed, not weight of cat!).  The prototype hardware is based on a 3D printed auger and some central vacuum fittings, and lots of hot-glue.

This project is intended to be a hardware prototype for a network-connected device with the same functionality.

## Hardware Required

* Arduino Board (developed on the Arduino Pro Mini)
* Servo Motor
* Hook-up wires
* button (mainly for debugging)
* DS3120 RTC
* HX711
* Load cell (developed with 1kg-rated device)
* 3D printed components for scale
* 3D printed components for feed auger
* central-vaccum fittings for feed auger

## 3D printed components
This is what was used while developing this code.
